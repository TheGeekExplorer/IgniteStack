# IgniteStack

IgniteStack is an MVC web framework written in PHP as a lightweight alternative, it is the sister of Velocious (the super-lightweight dispatch-based framework).  This framework is the culmination of 4 years of work refining the most logical MVC framework with the smallest footprint possible, while having enough features to actually make life easier!

### Who is IgniteStack for?

The framework has been written for Booker Ltd, and remains the property of Booker Ltd, and has been used on a number of projects within the Digital Team's remit, such as RaspberrySource, Boa (Boast), and a previous incarnation was used for PreSell Portal and Premier Blog.

### What is the current state of the project?

IgniteStack is not actively maintained, and the current code version is stable and in Long Term Support, so while no active development is on-going, fixes and patches can be produced as required.

### What is the future of the project?

The project has quite a lot to be updated or improved if it is to carry on being the right choice for small-scale projects.

##### Synergies with the Velocious project

I have thought about merging some of the emergent functionality in Velocious into IgniteStack to improve it, such as REGEX-based routes, Request Method filtering for routes, and avoiding XML-based configuration.

##### Shortcomings

IgniteStack has some serious shortcomings, and these really do need to be resolved if the project is meant to be production-worthy into 2017 and beyond :-

    -  Session management is very basic, and potentially now insecure
    -  There are no unit tests for the project!
    -  The directory structure and class/method structure is not very intuitive
    -  It's written for PHP 5.6 and should be rewritten into 7.1 with Strict Typing etc.

##### Summary

At this point there are no intentions to implement this in the immediate term.
